## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Set Up the Project Repo (DONE)
1. Create a new repo called `github-actions-capstone` (or use your existing `github-actions-practice`)
2. Add a simple app — pick any one:
   - A Python Flask/FastAPI app with one endpoint
   - A Node.js Express app with one endpoint
   - Your Dockerized app from Day 36
3. Add a `Dockerfile` and a basic test (even a script that curls the health endpoint counts)
4. Add a `README.md` with a project description

---

### Task 2: Reusable Workflow — Build & Test (DONE)
Create `.github/workflows/reusable-build-test.yml`:
1. Trigger: `workflow_call`
2. Inputs: `python_version` (or `node_version`), `run_tests` (boolean, default: true)
3. Steps:
   - Check out code
   - Set up the language runtime
   - Install dependencies
   - Run tests (only if `run_tests` is true)
   - Set output: `test_result` with value `passed` or `failed`

This workflow does NOT deploy — it only builds and tests.

---

### Task 3: Reusable Workflow — Docker Build & Push (DONE)
Create `.github/workflows/reusable-docker.yml`:
1. Trigger: `workflow_call`
2. Inputs: `image_name` (string), `tag` (string)
3. Secrets: `docker_username`, `docker_token`
4. Steps:
   - Check out code
   - Log in to Docker Hub
   - Build and push the image with the given tag
   - Set output: `image_url` with the full image path

---

### Task 4: PR Pipeline (DONE)
Create `.github/workflows/pr-pipeline.yml`:
1. Trigger: `pull_request` to `main` (types: `opened`, `synchronize`)
2. Call the reusable build-test workflow:
   - Run tests: `true`
3. Add a standalone job `pr-comment` that:
   - Runs after the build-test job
   - Prints a summary: "PR checks passed for branch: `<branch>`"
4. Do **NOT** build or push Docker images on PRs

**Verify:** Open a PR — does it run tests only (no Docker push)?

---

### Task 5: Main Branch Pipeline (DONE)
Create `.github/workflows/main-pipeline.yml`:
1. Trigger: `push` to `main`
2. Job 1: Call the reusable build-test workflow
3. Job 2 (depends on Job 1): Call the reusable Docker workflow
   - Tag: `latest` and `sha-<short-commit-hash>`
4. Job 3 (depends on Job 2): `deploy` job that:
   - Prints "Deploying image: `<image_url>` to production"
   - Uses `environment: production` (set this up in repo Settings → Environments)
   - Requires manual approval if you've set up environment protection rules

**Verify:** Merge a PR to `main` — does it run tests → build Docker → deploy in sequence?

---

### Task 6: Scheduled Health Check (DONE)
Create `.github/workflows/health-check.yml`:
1. Trigger: `schedule` with cron `'0 */12 * * *'` (every 12 hours) + `workflow_dispatch` for manual testing
2. Steps:
   - Pull your latest Docker image
   - Run the container in detached mode
   - Wait 5 seconds, then curl the health endpoint
   - Print pass/fail based on the response
   - Stop and remove the container
3. Add a step that creates a summary using `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`:
   ```bash
   echo "## Health Check Report" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
   echo "- Image: myapp:latest" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
   echo "- Status: PASSED" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
   echo "- Time: $(date)" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
   ```

---

### Task 7: Add Badges & Documentation (DONE)
1. Add status badges for all your workflows to the repo `README.md`
2. Add a **pipeline architecture diagram** in your notes — draw (or describe) the flow:
   ```
   PR opened → build & test → PR checks pass
   Merge to main → build & test → Docker build & push → deploy
   Every 12 hours → health check
   ```

3. Fill in your notes: What would you add next? (Slack notifications? Multi-environment? Rollback?)
```bash
I would like to add all 3 as they all have high priority in making my project production ready and fully running.

## Brownie Points: Add Security to Your Pipeline (DAY-49)
Want to go above and beyond? Add a **DevSecOps** step to your main pipeline:
1. Add `aquasecurity/trivy-action` after the Docker build step to scan your image for vulnerabilities
2. Fail the pipeline if any **CRITICAL** severity CVE is found
3. Upload the scan report as an artifact

This is a preview of what you'll do in depth on **Day 49**. If you get this working today, you're already thinking like a DevSecOps engineer.

## Hints
- Environment protection: Repo Settings → Environments → Add `production` → enable "Required reviewers"
- `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` renders markdown in the Actions run summary page
- Short SHA for tags: `$(echo ${{ github.sha }} | cut -c1-7)`
- Reusable workflow outputs: accessed via `${{ needs.<job>.outputs.<name> }}`
- Use `actions/github-script` if you want to post PR comments programmatically
